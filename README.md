### MPMenuSystem - MultiplayerSessions

This is a plugin project for Unreal Engine 5, aimed at streamlining the entire process of creating, finding, and joining a multiplayer session, whether through LAN or via Steam, enabling crossplay between platforms such as PC and mobile.

It has already been implemented within the default ThirdPerson template of Unreal Engine as a demonstration.
